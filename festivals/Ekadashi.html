                <h2>Ekadashi</h2>
                <img src="/festivals/images/ekadashi img.jpeg" alt="Large Image 2" class="responsive-img">
                <p>The day of Ekadashi holds great significance for Vaishnavites. In a lunar month, this day occurs twice: once during the dark fortnight and once during the light fortnight. It's advised to abstain from food and liquids for the full day on Ekadashi. Scriptures claim that, on Ekadasi, sin is found in cereal grains. Therefore, on this day, one should refrain from eating grains and lentils. On Ekadasi, Vaishnavites fast for the delight of Lord Krishna. This is the reason knowing about the Ekadashi calendar is crucial for you.

                </p>

                <h3>Things to do on Ekadashi Day:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wake up early and take a shower. Stay calm and relax your mind and body.</li>
                    <li>Do not eat grains and lentils.</li>
                    <li>Give maximum time for spiritual activities like chanting the Holy Name, reading and hearing about the glories of The Lord.</li>
                    <li>If it is not possible to remain empty stomach,then one can have fruits or Ekadasi food prasad.</li>
                    <li>If have unintentionally missed Ekadashi, you can also fast on the next day of Ekadashi and discontinue fast on the third day. To avoid such mistakes, stay updated with Ekadashi calendar always.</li>
                    <li>Do not sleep in the daytime and also avoid shaving and oil massage this day.</li>
                    <li>If you don’t fast on Ekadashi, avoid having a meal more than one time in a day. It is recommended to not to have a meal after midday during Ekadashi.</li>
                    <li>Always make sure to break the fast during the Paran Time.</li>
                    <li>Also, avoid having heavy food initially as your stomach was empty during fasting and it might pain your stomach to eat heavy food all of sudden. Make sure to start a day with fresh fruit juices or light food.</li>
                    <li>Also, make sure to not overeat a day before fasting as it might become difficult for you to stay empty stomach on the day of fasting.</li>
                    
                </ul>
                <h3>Why is Ekadashi Fasting good for you?</h3>
                <h4>Good for digestion:</h4>
                <p>Fasting is beneficial for your health in addition to its spiritual benefits, which are undeniable on this auspicious day of Ekadashi. Your body and mind feel more relaxed than on other days since you don't feed your body hefty meals three times a day on the fasting day.</p>

                <h4>Connects your soul with the super soul:</h4>
                <p>People who fast on Ekadashi must spend the entire day remembering supreme power in order to atone for their sins and negative karma. Your fast may be ineffective if you don't think about God. Thus, if you fast with a pure heart, you can become one with the super soul.</p>

                <h4>Liberation from the life and death cycle:</h4>
                <p>Hindu sages hold that if you observe the Ekadashi fast without any sense of greed, it can help you break free from the vast cycles of life and death.</p>
                <p>Ekadashi is observed with great reverence and excitement at Iskco Kharghar. Sankirtan is held for a full day. Come fill yourself with enormous devotion, then.</p>

                <h3>What is the purpose of celebrating Ekadashi?</h3>
                <p>Ekadashi is celebrated on the eleventh day of every lunar fortnight. The name comes from the Sanskrit words "eka," which means "one," and "Dasha," which means "ten." In the Hindu religion, this day holds great spiritual significance as it is considered a day for introspection, meditation, and spiritual communication with Lord Krishna, the holy Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
                <p>Ekadashi is a time to take a vacation from everyday life to cleanse one's body, mind, and soul. By avoiding certain foods (grains, lentils, beans, etc.) and partaking in spiritual activities, devotees hope to increase their consciousness and become more intimate with the divine energies that govern the universe.</p>

                <h3>Importance of Donating on the Auspicious Day of Ekadashi</h3>
                <p>Ekadashi is a great time to reach out to the less fortunate in a spirit of selfless giving. Giving on this auspicious day promotes social good and unites you with the heavenly energies that are helpful throughout the Ekadashi</p>
                <p>Giving on Ekadashi is a gesture that transcends the material world. It is an acknowledgment of the interconnectedness of all beings and an expression of thankfulness for the abundance in our life. Whether you donate to Ekadashi to support educational projects, feed the hungry, or help maintain sacred sites, your giving becomes a sacred offering that multiplies the impact of your kindness.</p>

                <h3>Why Donate on Ekadashi to ISKCON Kharghar?</h3>
                <p>ISKCON Kharghar is a beacon of spiritual understanding that exemplifies the teachings of Lord Krishna. Your Ekadashi gift to ISKCON becomes an investment in spirituality rather than just money. The money raised is put towards a number of initiatives, such as community development, educational initiatives, and temple upkeep.</p>
                <p>Choosing to donate to ISKCON Kharghar on Ekadashi is a thoughtful way to align your resources with a noble and edifying cause. As you participate in the blossoming of this spiritual paradise, you actively spread the divine message of love, peace, and harmony.</p>
                
                <h3>Can I get a Tax benefit on the Ekadashi donation?</h3>
                <p>Yes, there are real repercussions for your wonderful deed of giving to Ekadashi. Under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act, donations made to ISKCON Kharghar are tax deductible. In other words, you help the larger good while also earning a financial gain from your tax exemption.
                </p>
                <p>Your donation becomes an investment in both good citizenship and the spiritual world. This tax advantage reminds you that your deeds, even if they are philanthropic, can improve your financial portfolio and your spiritual well-being.
                </p>

                <h3>What should be donated to Ekadashi?</h3>
                <p>Ekadashi encourages giving in a variety of ways. Giving to charities is always appreciated, but you should also think about including non-cash contributions. On this auspicious day, there are many great ways to give back. Some examples include supporting education initiatives, sponsoring meals for the less fortunate, and donating essentials.</p>
                <p>ISKCON Kharghar welcomes a variety of donations, so you can choose a method that fits with your goals and ideals. No matter how big or small, your gift has the power to improve lives and the general well-being of the community.</p>

                <h3>What not to do on Ekadashi?</h3>
                <p>When you begin this holy path of Ekadashi observance, keep in mind that there are some practices that are off limits on this day. During the Ekadashi fast, it is customary to refrain from consuming grains, beans, and specific vegetables. Furthermore, in order to fully utilise Ekadashi's spiritual abilities, refraining from negative words, deeds, and ideas is essential.
                    The core of Ekadashi is a deliberate, methodical dedication to self-purification. By abstaining from certain behaviours and adopting an optimistic outlook, you can maximise this sacred day's transformational potential.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Can we give money to Ekadashi?
                    </h3>
                    <p>The various activities and objectives of this auspicious day can be supported by your contributions and pledges. Contributions to organisations like ISKCON Dwarka that successfully spread the deep significance of Ekadashi ensure that your funds become a vehicle for good.
                        Your contribution to the upkeep and development of spiritual communities aids in the preservation and dissemination of ancient wisdom in the present era.
