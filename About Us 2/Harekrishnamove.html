                    You have already had a brief introduction to ISKCON, its goals, and its guiding principles. To address your inquiries about Who they are in more detail? Why do people continue to dance and sing in the streets? Why do they sing the same phrase over and over again? Let us walk you through the beginnings and development of the Hare Krishna movement.


                <h3>How did it start?</h3>
                <p>
                    The same ultimate cause, Lord Sri Krsna, manifested as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu five centuries ago and proclaimed that the recitation of His holy names, Hare Krsna, Hare Rama, would reach every town and village on the planet. After hundreds of years, Lord Caitanya's devoted disciples were still unsure of how and when His audacious prophecy would come to pass.



                </p>
                <p>Then, in 1965, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, then 69 years old, sailed from Mumbai to the United States on the steamship "Jaladuta." At a time when most people consider retiring, Srila Prabhupada set out on this difficult journey to fulfil Lord Caitanya's mission and to carry out his spiritual master Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur Prabhupada's instructions to bring the Srimad Bhagavatam and the Bhagavad-gita's message to the West.
                    Srila Prabhupada battled alone for the first year after coming to New York City in September 1965 in order to develop his Krishna-conscious movement. He led a modest life, gave lectures whenever and whenever he could, and eventually some tiny interest in his teachings was generated. Despite continuing to operate out of a modest Lower East Side storefront in New York City, Srila Prabhupada still established a global spiritual community in July 1966. 
                    </p>

                <p>He called it the International Society for Krishna Consciousness or ISKCON for short and thus began the Hare Krishna movement in America.
                        At the time of incorporation, Srila Prabhupada had not attracted even one committed follower. Undeterred, he enlisted volunteers from among the small group of regular attendees at his evening lectures to act as ISKCON’s first trustees.
                </p>


                <h3>What does it mean?</h3>

                <p>The Hare Krsna movement spreads awareness among the masses of spiritual reality and the culture that stems from it. It is distinct because of this.
                    Reviving our transcendental consciousness is a sublime process that is initiated by chanting Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare / Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Rama denotes the ultimate pleasure, Hare alludes to Krsna's inner pleasure power, known as Srimati Radharani, and Krsna is the all-attractive person.                    
                    
                </p>

                <img src="https://www.bathecho.co.uk/uploads/2016/04/harekrishna_Gaura-Purnima-2015.jpg" alt="Hare Krishna Movement">

                <p>Through the chanting of this transcendental frequency, all pollutants can be removed from our hearts.
                    Krsna consciousness is not something that the mind is forced to accept. The inherent natural vitality of the living thing is this consciousness.
                    The benefit of letting other living things hear the holy names while chanting aloud is another. This is consistent with a real religion's tenet that all people should gain from its practice. Sarve sukhino bhavantu, the Vedas declare, let everyone be joyful. Harinama-sankirtana, more than any other religious practice, satisfies that need in human civilization.
                    
                    </p>


                <p>Adherents of the Hare Krsna movement engage in congregational chanting through the traditional practice known as kirtana. Whether at the temple or outdoors, devotees typically stand or dance during kirtana. Everyone joins in as one person leads the song. Kirtanas, also known as harinamas, are held by devotees in public spaces so that others can gain from hearing the holy names of the Lord. Such inadvertent listening is seen by Krsna as devotional service, and it gives one the right to continue serving the Lord in the future.

                </p>
                <p>“harer-nama harer-nama harer-namaiva kevalam kalau nasty-eva nasty-eva nasty-eva gatir anyatha”


                </p>
                <p>‘Harinama, Harinama, Harinama is the only and foremost means to achieve emancipation. There is no other way, no other way, no other way in this age of Kali.’
