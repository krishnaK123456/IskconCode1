                <p>
                    “harer-nama harer-nama harer-namaiva kevalam kalau nasty-eva nasty-eva nasty-eva gatir anyatha”
                    ‘Harinama, Harinama, Harinama is the only and foremost means to achieve emancipation. There is no other way, no other way, no other way in this age of Kali.’
                    The ancient Vaishnava texts Srimad-Bhagavatam (a commentary on the Vedas), Srimad Bhagavad-gita (a collection of teachings by Lord Krishna), and Sri Chaitanya-Charitamrta (a collection of teachings by Lord Chaitanya) are the source of the doctrines of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). 
                </p>


                <h3>Origin</h3>
                <p>
                    These teachings' central thesis is that every living thing has an everlasting spirit soul with a unique link to God, or Krishna. Lord Chaitanya recognised that the spirit soul is "inconceivably one and different" from the Supreme Lord, or acintya bheda tattva, and so set Gaudiya Vaishnavism apart from other sampradayas. They are both spiritually identical, but the spirit soul is the Lord's little servant, and the Lord is infinite in amount.



                </p>

                <h3>As explained by Srila Prabhupada</h3>
                <img src="https://akincana.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-1.jpg" alt="Shrila Prabhupada">

                <p>The basic Hare Krishna beliefs can be summarized as follows:
                
                </p>

                <p> Beyond body soul exists: The very first step in self-realization is realizing one’s identity as separate from the body. “I am not this body but am spirit soul” is an essential realization for anyone who wants to transcend death and enter into the spiritual world beyond. It is not simply a matter of saying “I am not this body,” but of actually realizing it.
                </p>

                <p>One life is not everything, reinacarnation happens: Remembrances of past lives can be fascinating, but the real goal of understanding reincarnation is to become free from the painful cycle of birth in death. Srila Prabhupada warns This is not a very good business–to die and take birth again. We know that when we die we’ll have to enter again into the womb of a mother–and nowadays mothers are killing the children within the womb.

                    Beyond the material world spiritual world exists: In the material world there are so many inconveniences. So spiritual world, there is no inconvenience. Inebriety. It is a reflection of the spiritual world, but there are so many difficulties here. Therefore it is called the material world.
                    
                    Beyond living entity Supreme controller exists: Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ: “The supreme controller is Kṛṣṇa.” Sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ. This is our definition of God. God means supreme controller. A Supreme controller is someone who is not controlled by anyone but is the controller of everyone. That is God.
                    
                </p>


                <p>If God is real, how can I get in touch with Him? One experiences happiness the instant they comprehend who they are and how they relate to God. We have associated ourselves with the material world, which is why we are so miserable. We are therefore dissatisfied. Fear and anxiety stem from our mistaken identification with the material world. Since it purifies the heart, the sankirtana movement is the simplest method for achieving self-realization (bhakti yoga). "Harinama, Harinama, Harinama is the primary and exclusive way to attain liberation." In this era of Kali, there is really no other option.
                </p>

                <p>Process of Bhakti Yoga: A pure devotee has no plans other than those for the Lord’s service. “One can execute the process of bhakti-yoga successfully with full-hearted enthusiasm, perseverance, and determination, by following the prescribed duties in the association of devotees and by engaging completely in activities of goodness

                </p>
                <h3>Founder's Statement</h3>
                <p>The first declaration incorporating the faith was written by A.C. Bhakitivedanta Swami (1896–1977), well known as Srila Prabhupada, who started The Hare Krishna MovementTM in New York in 1966. Swami was born in Kolkata. This serves as a mission statement for ISKCON and is still relevant today.
                <br>
                    It reads as follows:
                
                </p>

                <p>1. To systematically propagate spiritual knowledge to society at large and to educate all people in the techniques of spiritual life to check the imbalance of values in life and to achieve real unity and peace in the world.

                </p>

                <p>2. To propagate a consciousness of Krishna (God), as it is revealed in the great scriptures of India, especially Bhagavad-gita andSrimad-Bhagavatam. We accept the principle of transmigration of the soul (reincarnation).e</p>

                <p>3. To bring the members of the Society together with each other and nearer to Krishna, the prime entity, thus developing the idea within the members, and humanity at large, that each soul is part and parcel of the quality of the Godhead (Krishna).</p>

                <p>4. To teach and encourage the sankirtana movement, congregational chanting of the holy name of God, as revealed in the teachings of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>

                <p>5. To erect for the members and society at large a holy place of transcendental pastimes dedicated to the personality of Krishna.</p>

                <p>6. To bring the members closer together to teach a simpler, more natural way of life.</p>

                <p>7. To achieve the aforementioned purposes, to publish and distribute periodicals, magazines, books and other writings and to create websites that help realize these purposes.
